# Infra

BlockFLow depends on multiple, external services: IPFS and Ethereum. The BlockFLow code supports running these external services
on either your local machine (e.g. using `127.0.0.1`) without authentication nor SSL, or on remote machines with hostnames
with LetsEncrypt SSL and authentication.

## Locally
See [local/README.md](local/README.md)

## Remotely
