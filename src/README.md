# BlockFLow

BlockFLow secures federated machine learning through differential privacy and blockchain smart contracts.

Features:
* __Differentially private__: Clients' data is protected via differential privacy. BlockFLow supports multiple methods of differential privacy, including input and output perturbation.
* __Verifiable__: Clients' score each-others models. An Ethereum blockchain smart contract runs the audit and creates incentives for clients to both contribute robust model and score others' models fairly.
* __Fully decentralized__: No central third party is required. Clients communicate directly with each-other via IPFS and through the Ethereum Blockchain Smart Contract.
* __Flexible__: BlockFLow is compatible with any machine learning framework and most types of machine learning models. We have evaluated it on logistic regression models.
